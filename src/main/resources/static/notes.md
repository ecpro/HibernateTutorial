**Hibernate Notes**

No EntityManager with actual transaction available for current thread Exception : Mark Class as transactional

JPQL queries from Entities

@Table is hibernate specific and @Entity belongs to javax.persistance

For JPQL we use entity name and HQL we use table name. However they both point to same object
